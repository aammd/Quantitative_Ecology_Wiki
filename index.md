Ecostats
========

An exploration of GLM, random effects and mixed-effects, from the point of view of (a) young ecologist(s)

This wiki is about statistics as ecologists use them. There are many
methods to choose from in ecology, and the choice can be bewildering for
many young ecologists. Linear mixed models seem particularly difficult
to design, interpret, and report.

Some things I hope we can accomplish:

-   *how* linear mixed models function
-   *when* to use them, when to ignore them
-   *which* test to use (perhaps as a key?)
-   *comparison* of various R packages for fitting these models
-   *simulation* of analysis
-   *worked examples* of correct analysis
-   *advice* on proper reporting of results
-   *references* There are a great many books on the
    topic and web resources. I'd like to keep an organized list of
    these.

I've learned a lot just by making this!
